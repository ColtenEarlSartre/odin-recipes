    <p>I didn't feel any newfound pleasure or joy upon discovering this recipe, but rather the onset of a now ever-present low level despondence.  The specific strain of 
        'misanthrope who wants everyone else to suffer alongside them' that generally prepares this dish is the very same as those
         who just 'wanted to see how you'd react'. Please respond by clicking the 'Back' button on your browser.  
        Alternatively, brave souls may seek to quickly scroll through the following recipe (avert your eyes!) until the 'Home' link at the button can be found.</p>

        <li>Add a second slice of bologna, then continue until all of the slices are used.</li>
        <li>Then use the remainder of the cream cheese to finish 'frosting' the cake.</li>

        <li>Finish off with a sprig of cilantro on top or some pimento stuffed olives.</li>
